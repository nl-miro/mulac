# Eventing Specification

## Overview

The eventing module is the write-side component responsible for accepting domain events and delivering them to subscribers. It is the counterpart to command handling: command handlers produce `NewEventEnvelope` instances, and the eventing module either delivers them immediately or stores them durably for later delivery.

`EventGateway` is the single entry point for event dispatch. Callers, including `CommandDispatcher`, pass a `NewEventEnvelope` to the gateway; the gateway decides how execution proceeds based on the configured variant:

- **Direct**: the gateway immediately delegates to `EventDispatcher`, which invokes the configured subscriber port synchronously. No durable state; errors propagate immediately to the caller.
- **TwoPhased**: the gateway persists a durable `NewEventEntry` and returns. A separate consumer loop later reserves each entry and passes it to `EventDispatcher`, with retry and stale-reservation recovery.

`EventDispatcher` is the shared delivery engine for both variants. It receives an event envelope and invokes the registered subscriber port. The subscriber port may represent a single subscriber, a composite subscriber registry, or an adapter such as the Outbox.

The TwoPhased variant guarantees at-least-once delivery. Event subscribers must therefore tolerate duplicate delivery. Direct delivery is synchronous and has no automatic retry record.

## Architecture

The module follows the same hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture as command handling:

```
domain  ←  application  ←  features  ←  infra adapters
```

- **domain** (`eventing/assembly/domain.rs`): `EventStatus` and query criteria — no I/O, no external adapter types
- **application** (`eventing/assembly/application.rs`): envelopes, port traits, error type — no implementation
- **features** (`record_events.rs`, `event_consumer.rs`, `stale_event_sweep.rs`, `dispatcher.rs`, `gateway.rs`): use-case orchestration — depends on ports only
- **infra adapters** (`eventing/assembly/infra_diesel.rs`): concrete I/O — depends on feature and application layers

External callers import exclusively from `lib.rs` via the `io` re-export facade.

## Variants

### Direct

Execution is synchronous and in-flight only. No database table, reservation mechanism, or retry record is involved.

1. The caller passes a `NewEventEnvelope` to `EventGateway`.
2. The gateway delegates immediately to `EventDispatcher`.
3. The dispatcher invokes `EventSubscriberPort::handle`.
4. On success, the gateway returns `Ok(())` to the caller.
5. On failure, the error propagates to the caller. Any subscriber side effects already applied remain in place; no automatic retry is available.

Direct eventing is suitable for tests, local-only flows, or request-response paths where the caller controls retry and all subscribers are idempotent.

### TwoPhased

Execution is decoupled and durable. The gateway persists a `NewEventEntry` and returns; a consumer loop does the actual delivery via `EventDispatcher`.

1. The caller passes a `NewEventEnvelope` to `EventGateway`.
2. The gateway stores a `NewEventEntry` with status `Received` via `EventStorePort` and returns.
3. The event is now durably queued; the caller's work is done.
4. A worker drives a consumer loop that reserves eligible entries atomically via `EventReservePort`.
5. For each reserved `EventEnvelope`, the consumer reconstructs a `NewEventEnvelope` and passes it to `EventDispatcher`.
6. The dispatcher invokes the subscriber port.
7. On success: the consumer marks the entry `Completed` via `EventProcessPort`.
8. On failure: the consumer marks the entry `Failed` and schedules a retry, or `Dead` if the retry limit is exhausted.
9. A separate sweep job releases entries stuck in `Reserved` longer than the configured timeout.

## Components

### EventGateway

The single entry point for all event dispatch. Callers never interact with `EventRecorder` directly.

- Accepts a `NewEventEnvelope` from command handling or application code.
- Requires `metadata.event_id`; the caller is responsible for supplying it. UUID v7 is recommended.
- **Direct**: delegates immediately to `EventDispatcher`.
- **TwoPhased**: stores the event via `EventRecorder` and returns. Does not invoke `EventDispatcher`.
- Implements the command-side `EventDispatchPort` so `CommandDispatcher` can hand off produced events without depending on eventing internals.

### EventDispatcher

Shared delivery engine used by both variants. Not called directly by application code.

- Receives a `NewEventEnvelope` from the gateway in Direct mode or from the event consumer in TwoPhased mode.
- Invokes `EventSubscriberPort::handle`.
- Returns success only after the subscriber port has accepted the event.
- Treats zero subscribers as success when the subscriber port is implemented as a registry/composite; absence of subscribers is not a dispatch error.

### EventRecorder / EventRecorderRepository

Use case: persist a `NewEventEnvelope` durably before subscriber delivery (TwoPhased only).

- Receives a `NewEventEnvelope` directly; no conversion or ID generation is performed outside infra conversion.
- Delegates persistence to `EventStorePort`.
- Duplicate inserts for the same `event_id` are ignored by the Diesel adapter (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).

### EventConsumer / EventConsumerRepository

Use case: reserve persisted events and deliver them via `EventDispatcher` (TwoPhased only).

- Reserves up to `limit` eligible entries atomically.
- Converts each reserved `EventEnvelope` back into a `NewEventEnvelope`.
- Delivers each event through `EventDispatcher`.
- Marks each entry `Completed` or `Failed` based on the dispatcher outcome.
- Returns all errors collected across the batch; does not abort the batch on first error.

### EventSweeper

Use case: release stale reservations back to the eligible queue (TwoPhased only).

- Finds all `Reserved` entries whose `reserved_at` is older than the configured timeout.
- Resets them to `Failed` with retry scheduling, clearing reservation fields.
- Does **not** increment the attempt counter; only explicit `failed()` calls count as attempts.

### EventStoreStorage (infra, Diesel)

Implements `EventStorePort`. Inserts a new `event_entries` row. Does not touch existing rows on conflict, making event recording idempotent by `event_id`.

### EventConsumerStorage (infra, Diesel)

Implements `EventReservePort`, `EventProcessPort`, and `EventSweepPort`.

- **reserve**: uses `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, then updates status to `Reserved`, assigns `reservation_id` (UUID v7), increments `attempts`, and returns full event envelopes.
- **completed**: updates status to `Completed`, clears `reservation_id` and `reserved_at`, and sets `processed_at`.
- **failed**: evaluates `attempts` against `max_attempts`; transitions to `Failed` (schedules retry) or `Dead` (exhausted). Clears reservation fields.
- **sweep**: releases stale `Reserved` entries by clearing reservation fields and scheduling another attempt without incrementing `attempts`.

## Models

### EventStatus (domain)

| Variant     | Code | Description                                   |
|-------------|------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Received`  | `0`  | Stored, eligible for reservation              |
| `Reserved`  | `2`  | Claimed by a consumer                         |
| `Failed`    | `4`  | Delivery failed; scheduled for retry          |
| `Completed` | `5`  | Successfully delivered to the subscriber port |
| `Dead`      | `7`  | Retry limit exhausted                         |
| `Archive`   | `8`  | Archived (no further processing)              |

Numeric codes use intentional gaps (1, 3, 6 are reserved for future insertion without renumbering). See [ADR-002](adr/002-status-code-gaps.md).

### NewEventEnvelope (application)

The gateway input envelope. `event_id` is always supplied inside metadata; no generation occurs inside the system boundary.

| Field        | Type                       | Description              |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| `event_type` | `String`                   | Subscriber discriminator |
| `payload`    | `String`                   | Raw event body           |
| `metadata`   | `Option<NewEventMetadata>` | Routing/correlation data |

### NewEventMetadata (application)

| Field            | Type             | Description                                      |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `event_id`       | `Uuid`           | Stable deduplication ID (required)               |
| `correlation_id` | `Option<Uuid>`   | Cross-service correlation chain                  |
| `causation_id`   | `Option<Uuid>`   | ID of the command/message that caused this event |
| `source`         | `Option<String>` | Originating service identifier                   |

When events are produced from a command, `causation_id` should be the command's `command_id`. `correlation_id` should be propagated from the incoming command or inbox message when available.

### EventEnvelope (application)

Read-side envelope returned to the consumer after reservation. Constructed by the infra layer from the stored `EventEntry`; contains all fields the consumer needs without exposing infra types.

| Field            | Type                    | Description                                    |
|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `id`             | `Uuid`                  | Entry identifier, used to mark complete/failed |
| `reservation_id` | `Uuid`                  | Ownership token, required for process calls    |
| `event_type`     | `String`                | Subscriber discriminator                       |
| `payload`        | `String`                | Raw event body                                 |
| `attempts`       | `i32`                   | Number of times reserved so far                |
| `metadata`       | `Option<EventMetadata>` | Decoded routing and correlation metadata       |

### EventMetadata (application)

| Field            | Type             | Description                                      |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `event_id`       | `Uuid`           | Stable deduplication ID                          |
| `correlation_id` | `Option<Uuid>`   | Cross-service correlation chain                  |
| `causation_id`   | `Option<Uuid>`   | ID of the command/message that caused this event |
| `source`         | `Option<String>` | Originating service identifier                   |

### ReservableEventSpec (event_consumer)

| Field          | Default | Description                                        |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `limit`        | —       | Maximum number of entries to reserve per call      |
| `max_attempts` | `6`     | Entries at or above this attempt count are skipped |

Builds query criteria: `StatusIn([Received, Failed])`, `ScheduledBeforeNow`, `MaxAttempts(max_attempts)`, `OrderByScheduledAtAsc`.

### StaleEventSpec (stale_event_sweep)

| Field          | Default | Description                                                      |
|----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `timeout`      | —       | Staleness threshold; entries reserved longer than this are swept |
| `max_attempts` | `6`     | Max attempts forwarded to the retry policy                       |

Builds query criteria: `ReservedBefore(Utc::now() - timeout)`.

### EventError (application)

| Variant               | Description                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Storage`             | Storage adapter error                       |
| `Reservation`         | Reservation query or update failure         |
| `SubscriberNotFound`  | No subscriber registry/handler is available |
| `SubscriberExecution` | Subscriber returned an error                |
| `MissingReservation`  | Entry returned without a reservation_id     |
| `Conversion`          | Envelope conversion failure                 |

## Ports

### EventDispatchPort

Command handling depends on this port when handing off produced events.

```rust
fn dispatch(&self, event: NewEventEnvelope) -> Result<(), CommandError>;
```

The eventing gateway implements this port. It maps eventing errors into `CommandError::EventDispatch` for the command side.

### EventStorePort

```rust
fn record(&self, envelope: &NewEventEnvelope) -> Result<(), EventError>;
```

### EventReservePort

```rust
fn reserve(&self, spec: &ReservableEventSpec) -> Result<Vec<EventEnvelope>, EventError>;
```

### EventProcessPort

```rust
fn completed(&self, id: Uuid, reservation_id: Uuid) -> Result<(), EventError>;
fn failed(&self, id: Uuid, reservation_id: Uuid, max_attempts: i32) -> Result<(), EventError>;
```

### EventSweepPort

```rust
fn sweep(&self, spec: &StaleEventSpec) -> Result<u64, EventError>;
```

### EventSubscriberPort

```rust
fn handle(&self, envelope: &NewEventEnvelope) -> Result<(), EventError>;
```

Implementations may be concrete subscribers, composite subscriber registries, or adapters to other components such as the Outbox.

## Infra Models

These types are defined in `eventing/assembly/infra_diesel.rs` and are only available with the `diesel` feature. They are not referenced by application or feature layers.

### EventEntry (infra, Diesel)

Queryable struct mapping the full `event_entries` row. Constructed by `EventConsumerStorage` and converted into `EventEnvelope` before being returned across the port boundary.

| Field            | Type                    | Description                             |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `id`             | `Uuid`                  | Primary key; equals `metadata.event_id` |
| `event_type`     | `String`                | Subscriber discriminator                |
| `status`         | `i32`                   | Encoded `EventStatus`                   |
| `payload`        | `String`                | Raw event body                          |
| `meta`           | `Option<MetadataJsonb>` | JSONB-serialized event metadata         |
| `scheduled_at`   | `DateTime<Utc>`         | Earliest eligible-for-reservation time  |
| `attempts`       | `i32`                   | Number of reservations                  |
| `reservation_id` | `Option<Uuid>`          | Current reservation token               |
| `reserved_at`    | `Option<DateTime<Utc>>` | Current reservation timestamp           |
| `received_at`    | `DateTime<Utc>`         | Initial storage timestamp               |
| `updated_at`     | `DateTime<Utc>`         | Last state-change timestamp             |
| `processed_at`   | `Option<DateTime<Utc>>` | Completion timestamp                    |

### NewEventEntry (infra, Diesel)

Insertable struct used only by `EventStoreStorage`.

| Field          | Type                    | Description                          |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `id`           | `Uuid`                  | Primary key from `metadata.event_id` |
| `event_type`   | `String`                | Subscriber discriminator             |
| `payload`      | `String`                | Raw event body                       |
| `meta`         | `Option<MetadataJsonb>` | JSONB-serialized metadata            |
| `scheduled_at` | `DateTime<Utc>`         | Initial reservation eligibility      |
| `received_at`  | `DateTime<Utc>`         | Initial storage timestamp            |

## Database Schema

Table: `event_entries`

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_entries (
    id              UUID         PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type      TEXT         NOT NULL,
    status          INTEGER      NOT NULL,
    payload         TEXT         NOT NULL,
    meta            JSONB,
    scheduled_at    TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    attempts        INTEGER      NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    reservation_id  UUID,
    reserved_at     TIMESTAMPTZ,
    received_at     TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ  NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    processed_at    TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

Recommended indexes:

- `(status, scheduled_at)` — reservation queries
- `(status, reserved_at)` — stale sweep queries
- `(event_type, received_at)` — operational inspection by event type

## Retry Policy

Applies to `failed()` transitions:

- Retry delay = `attempts × 30 seconds`
- Cap: 2 minutes per attempt
- After `max_attempts` (default 6) the entry transitions to `Dead`
- Stale sweep does **not** increment the attempt counter

## Reliability Semantics

### Direct

- No durable acceptance point exists.
- Subscriber delivery is attempted inline.
- If the subscriber fails, the error propagates to the caller.
- If a composite subscriber invokes some subscribers before one fails, already-completed subscriber side effects are not rolled back.
- Retrying Direct dispatch can re-invoke subscribers that already succeeded.

### TwoPhased

- Acceptance is signalled only after durable storage of the `EventEntry`.
- Delivery to the subscriber port is at-least-once.
- A reserved entry cannot be concurrently claimed by another consumer.
- If delivery succeeds but marking `Completed` fails, the entry can be retried and delivered again.
- If a composite subscriber partially succeeds before returning an error, retry can re-invoke already-successful subscribers.
- Event ordering is not guaranteed across entries or after retries.

## Feature Flags

| Feature  | Adds                                                                |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `diesel` | PostgreSQL/Diesel storage adapters, schema module, and infra models |

## Examples

### Direct eventing

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use uuid::Uuid;
use write_side::io::{EventDispatcher, EventGateway, NewEventEnvelope, NewEventMetadata};

let dispatcher = Arc::new(EventDispatcher::new(subscriber));
let gateway = EventGateway::direct(dispatcher);

gateway.dispatch(NewEventEnvelope {
    event_type: "todo.created".to_string(),
    payload: r#"{"title":"Write spec"}"#.to_string(),
    metadata: Some(NewEventMetadata {
        event_id: Uuid::now_v7(),
        correlation_id: None,
        causation_id: None,
        source: Some("todo-service".to_string()),
    }),
})?;
```

### Two-phased eventing

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use write_side::io::{
    EventConsumer, EventConsumerRepository, EventDispatcher, EventGateway, EventRecorder,
    EventRecorderRepository, EventStoreStorage, EventConsumerStorage, ReservableEventSpec,
};

let store = Arc::new(EventStoreStorage::new(pool.clone()));
let recorder_repo = Arc::new(EventRecorderRepository::new(store));
let recorder = Arc::new(EventRecorder::new(recorder_repo));
let gateway = EventGateway::two_phased(recorder);

// CommandDispatcher calls gateway.dispatch(event) and returns after durable storage.

let consumer_storage = Arc::new(EventConsumerStorage::new(pool));
let consumer_repo = EventConsumerRepository::new(consumer_storage.clone(), consumer_storage);
let dispatcher = Arc::new(EventDispatcher::new(subscriber));
let consumer = EventConsumer::new(consumer_repo, dispatcher);

consumer.consume(&ReservableEventSpec::new(100))?;
```

## Implementation Notes

- `EventStatus` should live in `eventing/assembly/domain.rs`; `eventing/model.rs` remains only as a backwards-compatible re-export shim.
- `EventDispatchPort` is the boundary between command handling and eventing. The command side should not depend on eventing concrete types beyond this port and `NewEventEnvelope`.
- `EventSubscriberPort` should remain deliberately small. Subscriber resolution, fan-out, filtering, and outbox transformation belong in implementations behind the port, not in the core dispatcher.
- `EventGateway` should reject envelopes with missing metadata before either direct dispatch or durable recording, because `event_id` is required for deduplication.
- The Diesel adapter should use UUID v7 for `reservation_id` and should use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` when inserting events.
